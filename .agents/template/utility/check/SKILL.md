description: Check a plugin repository against the shared layout and standard — the one folder structure, the vendored files from Template's main branch, the skills and sections its type requires, frontmatter and profiles. The canonical description of the plugin layout. Use when asked whether a plugin repository conforms, before delivering a structural change to one, or when a layout question comes up.

# Plugin repository check

Every plugin repository, Template included, has the same layout. The repository name is the plugin namespace.

```text
<repo>/
  AGENTS.md  CLAUDE.md  README.md
  .gitattributes  .gitignore            vendored
  .github/workflows/ci.yml              vendored; calls Template's plugin-ci.yml from main
  plans/                                optional
  .agents/
    <plugin>/<kind>/<name>/SKILL.md     one folder per plugin; the main plugin is named after the repository
    <plugin>/<kind>/<name>/scripts/     a skill's own files sit beside it and ship beside it
    <plugin>/<kind>/<name>/templates/
    <plugin>/<kind>/<family>/<member>/SKILL.md   a family groups related skills; <family>/SKILL.md is optional
    tiers/<plugin>.json
    plugins/template.json               repository and type
    plugins/payloads.json               published plugins, dependencies, compatibility aliases
    plugins/manifests/{claude,codex}/<plugin>.json  marketplace.json
    hooks/  tests/                      optional
    sync_generated.py  sync-generated.ps1  vendored
  generated: .agents/INDEX.md  .claude/skills/  .codex/skills/  .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
             .agents/plugins/marketplace.json  plugins/<plugin>/
```

## Run it

```bash
python <skill-directory>/scripts/check.py --root <repository>
```

CI runs it against the current Template source. Run update to refresh vendored files when they differ.

## Skill families

Related skills share a family folder, family first: `state/client/` and `state/server/`, never `client-state/`
and `server-state/`. A skill's published name is its folder path below the kind folder joined by hyphens, so
`.agents/react/convention/state/client/SKILL.md` publishes `react:state-client`, and `result/carriers/` keeps the name
`result-carriers`. A family folder can hold its own `SKILL.md` as the family's shared rules; inside a skill
folder, only a folder with its own `SKILL.md` is a member, and anything else ships as that skill's files.
Renaming a published skill keeps its old name as a compatibility alias until its `removeAfter` date.

## What it enforces

- The vendored files equal the current Template source, with `ci.yml` rendered for the repository's owner.
- Only the layout's entries under `.agents/` and `.agents/plugins/`; `SOURCE_LAYOUT.md` and `sources.json` are retired.
- The skills its type in `standard.json` requires, with their kind, profile and sections:
  - **stack**: `knowledge`, `direction` (kind `knowledge`); `learning` (kind `policy`); `style`, `structure`
    (with `## File structure`), `domain-design`, `errors`, `testing`, `build`, `libraries` (kind `convention`);
    and a `scaffold` in any of its plugins. Its tier
    applies where the stack is present.
  - **tool**: `knowledge`, `direction` (kind `knowledge`); `learning` (kind `policy`); its tier always applies.
  - **utility**: only skills of kind `utility`; its tier declares `always` or `stack-present`. New utilities default to `always`.
  - **profile**: at least one policy in the main plugin, with supporting policies, conventions, workflows and
    utilities; its tier always applies after explicit project selection. Its generated host dependencies and
    harness requirements include the canonical `tj-agents/base` capability.
- A required skill's legacy kind (`contract` for a convention, `knowledge` for `learning`) still satisfies the
  check during the compatibility period; a fresh scaffold always emits the new kind.
- Every skill of kind `contract` or `convention` opens with an `Owns …` line after its title.
- Skill names are foldered: no flat names in one kind folder that share a hyphen-separated first or last word,
  nor a flat name sharing a family folder's word; no member repeating its family (`state/client-state/`); no
  name repeating its namespace (`dotnet-stack` under `dotnet`). Declared compatibility aliases are exempt.

The generator separately rejects malformed frontmatter, unresolved skill references and files that would not
ship. Extra skills beyond the required set are allowed.

## Corpus skill references

Run `python <skill-directory>/scripts/check_skill_references.py --root <repository> --root <sibling>`.
Each root inventories actual shipped `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`, including compatibility aliases.
The checker scans active authored skills and root AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and README.md, including descriptions.
It excludes historical plans, generated adapters, test fixtures and vendored templates.

Known plugin namespaces resolve qualified names; unknown namespaces need explicit skill wording or an invocation.
Bare names marked as skills resolve locally first, then uniquely across the corpus. Missing and ambiguous names fail
with file and line evidence. `--source-root` restricts authored scanning while every `--root` supplies inventory;
without it, every root is scanned. Public CI inventories the current repository, Template, core, react and dotnet.

A repository may declare exact external identities in `.agents/plugins/skill-references.json` under
`external_skills`, mapping each `namespace:skill` to its rationale. This covers standards shipped outside
the supplied corpus; wildcards and empty rationales fail. Extend the supplied corpus for sibling tj-agents plugins.
Detailed v3 tier predicates and harness requirements remain core's payload contract.
