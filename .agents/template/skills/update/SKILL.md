# Update from Template

```bash
python <skill-directory>/scripts/update.py --root <repository> [--dry-run]
```

It overwrites each vendored file that differs from the current Template source, removes a legacy config pin and top-level
manifest versions, then runs the repository's generator. --dry-run lists every change without writing. Make changes to
vendored files in Template.

Afterwards run `template:check`, review the diff and commit it as one change. `template:structure` owns
the source layout refreshed by these files.
