# Portable repository plugin configuration

Prerequisite of Tommy's approved optional work-items implementation, 2026-10-16.
Owner: codex:01a1415f-6448-7123-8b17-c7fb67aee637. Defect: B001 (resolved via PR24, merged eab0c1f65eb9e6597bf6340a217d8f0bb48352d0).
Base: fresh origin/main in isolated temporary clone. Branch: Fix/RepositoryPluginConfiguration.
Scope: named machine-owned configuration allowlist, focused regression, canonical CI owner and
Template 1.6.1 release. No existing consumer migrations or unrelated generator changes.
Gate: focused/full Template tests, generator freshness, package conformance, independent review,
Windows/Linux CI and published tag before work-items consumes the release.
Next: run checks, review, open and deliver source correction, then update work-items through template:update.
